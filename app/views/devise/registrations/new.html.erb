<h1> please be be aware that the email address will be used as your username and will be displayed. However the app will never email you so it does not have to actually be your email, it just needs to be in the email format.</h1>

<h2> also might be a good idea to use a password that is not used for any other application as I have not tested the security of the website and, although the password is encrypted, i cannot garantee it will be save. </h2>
